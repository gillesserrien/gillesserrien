# 👋 Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a passionate **gamer** and a student at **KdG**, studying **Multimedia and Creative Technologies**. When I'm not grinding in an **FPS** or getting lost in the world of **MMORPGs** (yeah, I recently started playing World of Warcraft 🧙‍♂️), you'll probably find me deep in code!

### 🎮 About Me:
- **Gamer** at heart (FPS main 🎯)
- Recently dived into **MMORPGs** like WoW 🐉
- **Student** at **KdG**, learning all things multimedia and tech 📚
- **Frontend & Backend Dev** (still figuring out what to specialize in 😅)
  
### ❤️ What I love:
I enjoy making things that people actually use and that make a difference in their lives.

Feel free to check out my projects, and let's build something awesome together! 🚀
